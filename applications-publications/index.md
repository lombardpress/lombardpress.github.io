# LombardPress-Components

The [*LombardPress-Components* Library](https://components.lombardpress.org/) is a library of React Web Components underlying most other LombardPress Web Applications and data visualizations. Building and maintain this component library is the core mission of LombardPress. The component library is designed to modularize common data-presentations needs so that they can be used in isolation or in composition with other components or integrated into larger front-end web applications. For example, many of the applications listed below are (or will be) entirely composed from these individual components.

# The SCTA Reading Room

The [*SCTA Reading Room*](https://scta.lombardpress.org) is single page web application composed from the LombardPress Web Components Library. In this Reading Room or "Workbench" users can explore SCTA data in a variety of ways: from simply reading the text, to comparing manuscripts, to exploring citation networks.

# The LBP Reader

[*LBP Reader*](https://reader.lombardpress.org) is static generated site (using the Next.js framework) to allow readers to read the SCTA corpus through minimalist interface design with a focus on distraction free reading. Because it is a static generated web page (html pages are pre-compiled) it is optimized for speed, search engine optimization, and minimal computing.

# Ad Fontes

[*Ad fontes*](https://lombardpress.org/adfontes) is specialized application for exploring quotations through the scholastic corpus. 

# Paleographinator

The [Palegraphinator](https://lombardpress.org/paleographinator) is an experimental site designed to allow users to search for Latin words and view their various abbreviations in variety of manuscripts sorted by place and time. It's a demo of what's possible, but certainly still a work in progress.

# LombardPress Print

[LombardPress Print](https://print.lombardpress.org/) is actually a web-service, not primarily intended for users to visit directly. Rather it is intended for other web applications to use in order to request on-demand PDF/Print renderings of SCTA data. A clear example of this is the [LombardPress PrintView Component](https://components.lombardpress.org/?path=/docs/components-printview--docs) which sends requests to the print service, listens for when the rendering is completed, and then makes the PDF rendering available for the user.

# LombardPress Schema

For historical reasons, the operative SCTA standards for semantically marking textual data is currently referred to as "LombardPress Schema". (The reason for this stems from the fact that the LombardPress idea began before the creation of the SCTA and the strict separation of data publication from front-end data visualization.) So while referred to as the "LombardPress Schema", these standards are better seen as part of the suite of standards governed by the SCTA. To view these standards, please see the [SCTA Documentation Page](https://community.scta.info/pages/docs). We anticipate, that future versions of these standards will receive a new nomenclature that will help maintain this important conceptual clarification.
