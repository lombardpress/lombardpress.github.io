  LombardPress is the publishing component of a digital ecosystem designed to help facilitate
  a new kind of editing and publication of historical texts.
</p>

<p>
  The primary focus of LombardPress is to facilitate the publication,
  dissemination, and study of scholastic commentaries and texts.
  LombardPress applications and publications are designed to use and publish information
  made available via emerging scholarly standards and APIs.
  In particular, we rely on the
  <a href="https://scta.info">Scholastic Commentaries and Text Archive (SCTA)</a>
  ontology, RDF Database, and accompanying APIs,
  as well as the <a href="http://iiif.io">International Image Interoperability Framework</a> API.
  Because these applications are built to understand common standards,
  LombardPress applications are designed to be re-usable for any data set
  that follows the same standards for data creation and dissemination.
